# MSPA 400 Session #7 Python Module #1

# Reading assignment:
# "Think Python" 2nd Edition (8.3-8.11)
# "Think Python" 3td Editon (pages 85-93)

# Module #1 objectives: 1) demonstrate a grid search for maxima
# and minima of a continuous function, 2) demonstrate the use of Boolean 
# values with conditionals and 3) plot the results.

# extrema() is a classification function used to evaluate a trio of points.
# The function will evaluate the middle point of trio to determine if it
# represents a relative maxima or minima for the trio. The result will be
# a boolean value True or False which will be used later.  Note that if the 
# middle point is not an extrema, the value False will be returned.

def extrema (a,b,c):
    x = max(a,b,c)
    z = min(a,b,c)
    epsilon = 0.0000001   # This is a safeguard against minor differences.
    result = False
    if abs(b - x) < epsilon:
        result = True
    if abs(b - z) < epsilon:
        result = True
    return result

    y= 1.603*x**4 - 23.258*x**3 + 62.12*x**2 + 6.992*x + 1010

# The following extrema evaluation will be over a defined interval. Grid points
# will be defined and the function extreme() will compare trios of values.
    
# Define interval endpoints for a closed interval [xa,xb].
xa= 0.0
xb= 7.0

# n = number of grid points.  The interval [xa,xb] will be subdivided.
# Adding delta to xb insures xb is included in the array generated.  For this
# purpose, np.arange() will be used to create a numpy array of floating point
# values to be used in subsequent calculations.

n= 1000
delta= (xb - xa)/n
x= np.arange(xa, xb+delta, delta)  
y=f(x)

value=[False]  # This defines the list value which will contain Boolean values.
value=value*len(x)  #This expands the list to the length of x.

# We are going to check each trio of points during the grid search.
# If a local extrema is found, the boolean value will be set to True.  
# Otherwise it will remain False. The interval endpoints are always local
# extrema so we define their boolean values first. 

L=len(x)
value[0] = True    # This will correspond to one endpoint.
value[L-1] =True   # This corresponds to the other.
    
# The for loop will check each consecutive trios of f values with the function
# extrema() to identify local extrema.  Only when an extrema is found will the
# boolean value in the list value be changed to True.

for k in range(L-2):
    value[k+1]=extrema(f(x[k]),f(x[k+1]),f(x[k+2]))
    
max_value=max(y)        # We check the list to find the global maxima.
min_value=min(y)        # We check the list to find the global minima.


# The following for loop checks the boolean value for each point. If the value
# is True, that point will be plotted yellow.  The global maximum is plotted as
# red and the minimum is plotted as green. We follow this up by plotting the
# values of x and y.

error=0.0000001         # The error parameter guards against roundoff error.
# The code which follows assigns colors to maxima and minima and plots them.
