# Math for Modelers Session #3 Module #1

# Reading assignment:  Investigate the Canopy Doc Manager.  Review the portion 
# dealing with Matplolib.  Review the gallery and the code used.

# Module #1 objectives: 1) plot inequalities with Matplotlib, and 
# 2) demonstrate how to show feasible regions.

# The first example will be from Lial Chapter 3 Section 3.1 Example 2.
# A graph of the inequality x - 4y > 4 will be shown. The first step is
# to generate a range of values for x. Then compute values for y.  This
# section will use arange() in place of linspace().  This function will
# generate a list of equally spaced values using the specified interval 0.1.
# It is inclusive of -2 and exclusive of 6.1.  We use 6.1 to insure inclusion
# of 6.0 in the resulting array x.

# Whenever a question arises about a function such as arange, the interpreter
# may be used to find additional information.  Enter arange? into the 
# interpreter to see how this works.

# Data points are plotted using variable z to define a boundary for the
# filled area.  z is a list with the same dimension as x and y.  It provides a
# lower boundary for the plot so that the region can be filled.

z= -2.0 + 0.0*x

# Region is filled to show the region.  fill_between() will fill between two
# lines.  It is difficult to use with irregular polygons.

# The next example shows how to plot a feasible region.  Refer to 
# Lial Section 3.1 Example 5.  This involves four inequalities;
# 2x-5y <= 10, x+2y <= 8, x >= 0, and y >= 0.  The steps are similar
# to what was shown above. figure() separates the two plots
