# MSPA 400 Session #3 Python Module #3

# Reading assignment:  Investigate the Canopy Doc Manager.  Review the portion 
# dealing with Matplotlib.  Review the gallery and the code used.

# 3) solve a linear programming problem.

# This is a minimization problem. One objective is to demonstrate plotting an 
# unbounded region.  There are four inequalities: x+3y >= 15, 3x+y >= 10,
# x >= 0, y >= 0. One inequality and the objective function have been
# modified for this module. The objective function is z = 2x+3y.  The feasible
# region will be graphed and filled.  Matrix methods will be used to evaluate
# the objective function at each corner.
