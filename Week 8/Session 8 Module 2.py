# MSPA 400 Session 8 Python Module #2

# Reading assignment:
# "Think Python" 2nd Edition Chapter 11 (11.1-11.8)
# "Think Python" 3rd Edition Chapter 11 (pages 121-132)

# Module #2 objectives:  1)  demonstrate how to handle negative areas with
# numerical integration, 2) plot results using Python fill_between, and 3)
# demonstrate the use of an inequality for plotting different colors.

# alpha controls the intensity of the color.
